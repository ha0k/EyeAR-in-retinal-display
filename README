EYEAR Standalone source code

Author: Damien Rompapas

System: Windows x64 (Latest working OS Windows 10, visual studio 2010)

Installation instructi9ons:


1) Install the following dependencies

- Cuda 7.5 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-75-downloads-archive
- OptiX 4.0 (located here: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/952430/optix/optix-4-0-is-released-/) newer versions of Optix may work, but are untested and unsupported)
- Boost 1.47 (included in the optional libraries file, or you can compile it)
- GLUT  (packaged in the source code)
- OpenGL (also packaged)
- OpenCV 3.0+ (Compile using visual studio 2010 Release x64)

2) download and extract the optional libraries package (located here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3soLwp6ieeJX2ktS1FrWUdmZU0 )
- extract to C: (path should look like c:\v2010

3) use CMAKE gui to configure a build to visual studio 2010 x64, hit configure, then generate. You will receive errors that libraries are not detected 
you can see the correct paths here: https://ibb.co/hATg6v
At the very least, CUDA and OPTIX should have been successfully detected and added


4) open the generated visual studio file in visual studio 2010, set the compile to release

5) build the EyeAR project (it will compile all the other projects as they are dependencies
(if the linker complains about missing linked files, edit the linker settings and remove the references)

6) once built, navigate to the built binary directory, exctract the sample config files (SampleFiles.zip in the repository) to the built binary location

7) You can now run the extracted bat file
